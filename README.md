# su-java-web-spring-project

Fullstack web application with Spring MVC as REST service and ReactJS for front end. The application is currently deployed at https://hello-english.herokuapp.com/#/ and running. You just have to wait for the app to wake up. This is how heroku works... the application goes to sleep when it's not being used for hours. 

To go through the whole app you can log in with the user with username fizz and password fizz who is the almighty god of all users. 

Don't judge the application by its html and css because it was the first time that I've touched them. (And yea.. some css breaks for unknown reasons...)

The web project includes almost everything that I've learned in the Softuni Java Web module. Locally I use MySQL, but for deployment in heroku the app works with PostGreSQL database. There's HATEOAS, validation done via aspected oriented programming, scheduler which tracks the activity on the site, unit testing on services with mocking and integration tests for controllers, testing covers almost 80 % of the project!
